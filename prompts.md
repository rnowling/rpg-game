Please generate a Python program that generates a map with borders displayed on the screen with stars and the user’s character displayed with an “@“ symbol. The user should be able to move the character up, down, left, or right one space at a time by entering the letters w, s, a, and d. The character should not be able to cross the map’s borders. The map should be no larger than 80 by 25 characters. 

## Make map larger than display window
